# Template for #30Days Projects


Read [About this site](SETUP.md) to learn how it was setup.

## What is #30Days?

It's about creating content and sharing insights that reflects a #30Days journey in doing something that builds a skill or habit. 
This project is about creating a template to _plan, track, and share_ a #30Days journey.

## Is 30 Days Enough?

We've all heard the saying "_it takes 30 days to form a habit_". 

[In his blog article](https://jamesclear.com/new-habit), James Clear estimates that it takes more than 2 months to sustain a habit - with a research study showing it could take anywhere between 18 - 254 days to make it sustainable. 

Then why stick with 30 days?
 * **First, because it was a convenient measure for planning**. A month provides a good foundation for 2 "bookend" days (kickoff on day 1, retrospective on day 30) with 4 "weeks" in between. We can now plan a mini-goal each week ("theme") and use that option to either building depth (expertise via progression) or breadth (knowledge via facets).

* **Second, because it fills meaningful tiles in our life calendar**. In the TED Talk ["Inside the mind of a master procrastinator"](https://www.ted.com/talks/tim_urban_inside_the_mind_of_a_master_procrastinator?language=en) Tim Urban talks about the [Life Calendar](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html) - an approach where you think about your life in _countable_ weeks so you can plan & track achievements, and motivate yourself to get things done. With #30Days, you can plan/fill 4 tiles at a time with learning goals & accomplishments.

## A #30Days Template

This section will continue to evolve as I explore new ideas. 

The key goals is to have a "30Days-in-a-Box" template repo that can be instantiated and customized to launch a new project. Here are some features it should have:

 * Playbook (document template usage)
 * Navigation Menu = key shortcuts
 * Landing Page = core components, call to action
 * Analytics = easy integration to track usage
 * Hosting = GitHub Pages (default), links to other options
 * Technology = using [Docusaurus v2](https://docusaurus.io)
 * Components
    - Blog = daily content updates
    - Post = template with custom sections, banner
    - Syndication = use as canonical source
    - Custom Issues = for community contribution
    - Discussions = for community interactions
    - Illustrations = for visual interest, learning
    - Tags = align to GitHub topics for consistency
    - Metadata = support OpenGraph, Twitter cards
 * Plugins or Extensions 
    - Search
    - Analytics
    - Code Embedding
    - Diagram Embedding
    - Downloadable PDF

## A #30Days Hub

Something to think about as a future steps - automated creation/maintenance of a central hub to support: 
 * **discovery** of #30Days roadmaps
 * **mix-and-match** into #100daysOfCode roadmaps
 * **showcase** of #30Days code projects/repos
 * **community** gallery of contributors, partipants
 * **calendar** to highlight related community events or study sprints
